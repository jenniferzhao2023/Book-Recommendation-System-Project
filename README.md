# Final-Project-Book-Recommendation-System

## Project/Goals
The book recommendation system provides personalized recommendations based on user interests and preferences.  Additionally, data wrangling and exploratory data analysis will be utilized to draw insights about usersâ€™ reading preferences and current trends in the book market.

Key Goals of the Project:
    Base-Case Recommendations for New Users: The recommendation engine will provide initial recommendations for new users based on their past ratings and/or other relevant keywords, ensuring relevant content suggestions.

    Personalized Recommendations through Collaborative Filtering: By utilizing user ID and search preferences, collaborative filtering techniques will generate personalized recommendations for active users based on their activity history and search preferences, enhancing the user experience.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains book information along with user ratings and is available from Kaggle.
    1.	Books.csv: book information(book title, authors, publish year). It consists of 27K rows.
    2.	Ratings.csv: book rating description(user_id, book_id, rating). It consists of 27K rows
    3.	Users.csv: user descriptions (user_id, location, age). It consists of 160K rows
    Due to the large data size, a subset was created by sampling 13,000 records from the original dataset.
## TECH STACK
    Language: Python
    Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn
    Sklearn Modules: TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity, TruncatedSVD, NearestNeighbors, Sparse_matrix
    Web Tools: Flask, HTML, Streamlit
    Models: KNN (K-Mean) and Truncated SVD Latent Factors model
## Process:
    
    1.Performmed EDA: 
        Conduct EDA to identify duplicates, drop unnecessary columns, and rename column names. Add a new column for modified book titles and use visualizationsto gain insights from the dataset.
        Average Rating and Number of Ratings: Calculate and add the average rating and number of ratings columns for each book and add an average rating column.
        Dataset Integration: Merge the rating dataset and book dataset to combine book information and user ratings.
    2. Data Analysis and Visualization
    3.Model building: 
        Popularity_based: List the top 20 popular books with the most ratings and higher average ratings.
        Content-Based Recommendation: Recommend books to users based on book similarity using Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarity of book features.
        Collaborative Recommendation with SVD:  Apply collaborative filtering techniques to discover patterns and similarities among users. Utilize user-item ratings and interactions to identify users with similar preferences.
    4. Web Deployment: Use Flask, HTML, Streamlit to deploy the model
## Future Goals
Enhancing Content-Based Book Recommendations with a Rich Dataset and Stable Neural Networks.
	1.Dataset: Dataset: Seek a comprehensive dataset with more features (genres, descriptions) to improve the model's performance.
	2.Building a more robust model by leveraging the PyTorch and TensorFlow deep learning libraries.
