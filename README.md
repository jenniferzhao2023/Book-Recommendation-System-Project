# Final-Project-Book-Recommendation-System

## Project/Goals
The book recommendation system provides personalized recommendations based on user interests and preferences.  Additionally, data wrangling and exploratory data analysis will be utilized to draw insights about usersâ€™ reading preferences and current trends in the book market.

Key Goals of the Project:
    Base-Case Recommendations for New Users: The recommendation engine will provide initial recommendations for new users based on their past ratings and/or other relevant keywords, ensuring relevant content suggestions.

    Personalized Recommendations through Collaborative Filtering: By utilizing user ID and search preferences, collaborative filtering techniques will generate personalized recommendations for active users based on their activity history and search preferences, enhancing the user experience.
## Dataset:
The dataset contains book information along with user ratings and is available from Kaggle.
    1.	Books.csv: book information(book title, authors, publish year). It consists of 27K rows.

    2.	Ratings.csv: book rating description(user_id, book_id, rating). It consists of 27K rows

    3.	Users.csv: user descriptions (user_id, location, age). It consists of 160K rows

    Due to the large data size, a subset was created by sampling 13,000 records from the original dataset.

## Process:
![Alt text](image-1.png)
    1. Perfrommed EDA:
        Identify duplicates, check missing value, drop unnecessary columns, and rename column names.
        Caculate and add the average rating and number of ratings columns for each book.
        Dataset integration: Merge the rating dataset and book dataset to combine book information and user ratings.
    2. Data Anallysis and Visualization: Data visualizaion to gain insights from the dataset.
    3. Model building:
       Polularity_based rcommendation: List the top 20 popular books with the most ratings and higher average ratings.
       Content_based recommendation: Recommend books to users based on book similarity usting Cosine similarity to calculate the similarity of book features.
       Collaborative recommendation with KNN and SVD: apply collaborative filtering techniques to discover patterns and similarties among users. Utilize user-item ratings and interactions to identify users with similar preferences.
    4. Web Deployment: Use Flask, HTML, Streamlit to deploy the website.
## Future Goals
Enhancing Content-Based Book Recommendations with a Rich Dataset and Stable Neural Networks.

	1.Dataset: Dataset: Seek a comprehensive dataset with more features (genres, descriptions) to improve the model's performance.

	2.Building a more robust model by leveraging the PyTorch and TensorFlow deep learning libraries.
