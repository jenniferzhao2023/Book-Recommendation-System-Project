# Final-Project-Book-Recommendation-System

## Project/Goals
The book recommendation system provides personalized recommendations based on user interests and preferences. Additionally, data wrangling and exploratory data analysis will be utilized to draw insights about usersâ€™ reading preferences and current trends in the book market.

Key Goals of the Project:
1. Base-Case Recommendations for New Users: The recommendation engine will provide initial recommendations for new users based on their past ratings and/or other relevant keywords, ensuring relevant content suggestions.
2. Personalized Recommendations through Collaborative Filtering: By utilizing user ID and search preferences, collaborative filtering techniques will generate personalized recommendations for active users based on their activity history and search preferences, enhancing the user experience.
## Dataset:
The dataset contains book information along with user ratings and is available from Kaggle.
1. Books.csv: book information(book title, authors, publish year). It consists of 27K rows.
2. Ratings.csv: book rating description(user_id, book_id, rating). It consists of 27K rows
3. Users.csv: user descriptions (user_id, location, age). It consists of 160K rows
Due to the large data size, a subset was created by sampling 13,000 records from the original dataset.
## TECH STACK
Language: Python
Libraries: Panda, Numpy, Seaborn
Sklearn Modules: TfidfVectorizer, cosine_sililarity, TruncatedSVD, NearestNeighbors, Sparse_matrix
Web Tools: Flask, HTML
Models: KNN(K-Mean) and Truncated SVD Latent Factors Model
   
## Process:
1. Perfrommed EDA:
   Identify duplicates, check missing values, drop unnecessary columns, and rename column names.
   Calculate and add the average rating and number of rating columns for each book.
   Dataset integration: Merge the rating dataset and book dataset to combine book information and user ratings.
2. Data Analysis and Visualization: Data visualization to gain insights from the dataset.
3. Model building:
   Polularity_based recommendations: List the top 20 popular books with the most ratings and higher average ratings.
   Content_based recommendation: Recommend books to users based on book similarity using Cosine similarity to calculate the similarity of book features.
   Collaborative recommendation with KNN and SVD: apply collaborative filtering techniques to discover patterns and similarities among users. Utilize user-item ratings and interactions to identify users with similar preferences.
4. Web Deployment: Use Flask and HTML to deploy the website.
## Future Goals
Enhancing Content-Based Book Recommendations with a Rich Dataset and Stable Neural Networks.
1. Dataset: Dataset: Seek a comprehensive dataset with more features (genres, descriptions) to improve the model's performance.
2. Building a more robust model by leveraging the PyTorch and TensorFlow deep learning libraries.
